#Summary of Results

While performing these analyses of the student grade data set, one can note many trends between school types, grades, and subject scores. 

For grade 9, the overall average math score was 66.6. After grouping the data by school type using.groupby(), we can see that for grade 9, charter schools had a higher average math score (70.0) compared to public schools (64). This same trend can be said for all the grades with the exception of grade 12. We can conclude that Charter Schools tend to have higher math scores than Public Schools. As far as reading scores are concerned, the average scores for Charter and Public Schools don't differ by much at all. When we compare grades only, we can see grade 9 tend to have the highest math scores. Regarding reading scores, grade 9 has the least average score, whereas grade 11 has the highest. Dixon High School, a Charter school with one of the highest number of total students, contained the student with the lowest overall reading score in Grade 10. Charter schools also have lower average budget amount than Public schools.

Additional analyses that help us come up with conclusions are grouping the data by grade only and comparing the scores of both subjects. We can also try to locate the highest score and lowest score in both subjects, and pinpoint whether the student was from a charter or public school and whether the school had a small population size or a large one. Analyzing the budgets by grade can also give us insight to the trends that are occurring.
